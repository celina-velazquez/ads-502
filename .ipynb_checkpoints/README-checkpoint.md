# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## Overview
This project explores breast cancer classification using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and analyzed using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.

## Project Details
- **Course**: University of San Diego, MS in Applied Data Science (ADS 502)
- **Tools Used**: Python, Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Goal**: To classify tumors as benign or malignant, providing insights for healthcare applications.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection
- ANN for classification
- Supervised machine learning for classification
- Evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the project in Jupyter Notebooks:
